                <h1>Top 10 JavaScript Frameworks for Web Developers in 2025</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="parag">
                <p>JavaScript has long been the backbone of modern web development, and with the ever-growing demand for interactive and dynamic web applications, frameworks built on JavaScript continue to evolve rapidly. As we move into 2025, web developers are constantly looking for the best tools to help them streamline their workflow and build powerful applications. In this blog, we will explore the top 10 JavaScript frameworks every developer should know in 2025.</p>
                <h2>1. React JS</h2>
                <p>React remains one of the most popular and widely used JavaScript frameworks in 2025. Developed by Facebook, React allows developers to build user interfaces (UIs) using components, making it easier to manage complex applications. Its virtual DOM ensures high performance, and with a vast ecosystem, React is perfect for both small and large-scale projects.</p>
                <h3>Why use React?</h3>
                <div class="react">
                    <ul>

                        <li>• Large developer community and ecosystem</li>
                        <li>• Excellent for single-page applications (SPAs)</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h2>2. Vue.js</h2>
                <p>Vue.js has gained significant traction in recent years due to its simplicity and flexibility. It’s lightweight, easy to integrate, and provides reactive data binding for smooth user interfaces. Vue is particularly favored by developers who need a progressive framework that can scale with the complexity of their applications.</p>
                <h3>Why use Vue?</h3>
                <div class="vue">
